# create-expo-app

A somewhat opinionated way to create React Native apps using Expo.

It provides configuration and a reasonable set of rules, it ensures that tooling and developer dependencies work well together (e.g. TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier, Jest, ...), and lastly, it creates a basic project structure.
