# create-expo-app

A somewhat opinionated way to create React Native apps using Expo.

Initializes an Expo app, provides a reasonable set of rules & configuration, installs and ensures tooling & developer dependencies (e.g. TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier, Jest, ...) work well together and finally, lays out a basic project structure.

## Usage

npx https://github.com/AppAndFlow/create-expo-app <app-name>
